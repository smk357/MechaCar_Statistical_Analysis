## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The following is the generated statistical summary based on linear regression to test all variable correlation with mpg (miles per gallon:

The summary reflects a strong regression model.

The main metrics of interest are the r-square and p-values. The high multiple r-square value of 0.7149 suggests strong variance of mpg caused by variance in all other dataset variables. This suggests a high slope value for the regression model.

The low p-value 5.35e-11 suggests strong correlation of mpg with the other dataset variables (low probability of null hypothesis).
